# [DPhi Data Sprint #20: Classification of Malware with PE headers](https://dphi.tech/practice/challenge/57)

<p align='justify'>
I developed a machine learning model to detect malware based on 3,888 VirusShare and Windows program files. Based on my official competition score, I achieved an f1-score of over 98.87% using a stacking algorithm composed of random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and managed placed in the top 2.57% (18th out of 701 entries) of the competition as of writing. <br><br>
