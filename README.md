  This repository contains my solutions to the <a href='http://dphi.tech'> DPhi </a> Data Sprints I have participated in since January 2021. On average, I have ranked in the top 31% of competition participants and managed to place in the top 6.4% at peak performance. My solutions have involved the use of machine learning ensemble classifiers and transfer learning with convolutional neural networks.
