### [Crop Recommendation for Indian Farmers using Machine Learning](https://dphi.tech/challenges/data-sprint-26-crop-recommendation/62/)
• Utilized 1,650 observations to improve crop selection and yield in India based on rainfall, climate, and fertilizer quality
• Achieved over 99.64% accuracy using an ensemble model composed of Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers
• Ranked 3rd among 47 participants of the DPhi Data Sprint #26 (online competition) 

### [DPhi Data Sprint #21: Classification of Malware with PE headers](https://dphi.tech/practice/challenge/57)

<p align='justify'>
I developed a machine learning model to detect malware based on 3,888 VirusShare and Windows program files. Based on my official competition score, I achieved an f1-score of over 98.87% using a stacking algorithm composed of random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and managed placed in the top 2.57% (18th out of 701 entries) of the competition as of writing. <br><br>
